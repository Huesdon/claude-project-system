name: task
description: >
  Universal project task backlog manager for any Claude Cowork project. Maintains a
  single source of truth at Reference/Claude/tasks.json containing every tier (T1,
  T2, T3, Roadmap) in one file — no separate backlog. On first run, creates the file
  and writes the standard Task Module section into the project CLAUDE.md. After
  init, manages the backlog: add tasks, mark complete with log, reprioritize,
  review, health, and get session recommendations. When T1/T2 is empty, surfaces
  Roadmap items to promote, or Ideas to promote to Roadmap. Every prompt uses
  AskUserQuestion; task pickers use numbered buttons (1/2/3) so long titles never
  break rendering. Invoke when the user says: "add a task", "log this as a task",
  "what should I work on", "reprioritize the backlog", "mark that done", "task
  backlog", "show me open tasks", "task status", "run task", or opens a new
  project and wants structured task tracking. Works standalone in any Cowork
  project.

# task — Project Task Backlog Manager

Single canonical file: `Reference/Claude/tasks.json` holds every task at every tier (T1, T2, T3, Roadmap). There is no separate backlog file. Order within the file is authoritative: REPRIORITIZE is the only way tasks move within the stack.

Completion log: `Reference/Claude/tasks_completed.log` (one line per completed task, lazy-created on first COMPLETE).

Completed tasks are removed from `tasks.json` and appended to the log.

---

## Response Button Rule (MANDATORY)

**Every question without exception uses `AskUserQuestion`.** No question is ever asked in prose. A response that ends with a question in plain text is a violation of this rule.

### Task-picker flows — Numbered button pattern

When the user is picking from a list of tasks, roadmap items, or ideas (anything with long titles), use the **numbered pattern**:

1. Present the list as a short numbered prose block above the buttons:
   ```
   1. Grep for stale 'double-click the cmd' references — T3
   2. Remove residual Windows-only language from cps-init SKILL.md — T3
   3. Update cps-setup SKILL.md Step 6 wording — T3
   ```
2. Present `AskUserQuestion` with button **labels** as single characters: `1`, `2`, `3`, plus a fourth option like `Show all`. The long title goes in the option **description** field, not the label.

This keeps buttons short and guarantees rendering even when titles are long.

**Binary and worded-option flows stay worded.** Short-option flows (tier picker: `T1` / `T2` / `T3` / `Roadmap`, Patch gate Yes/Not-yet, Impact scan multi-select) use their natural labels — the numbered pattern is only for picking from a list of items with long names.

## JSON Schema

```json
{
  "meta": {
    "last_updated": "YYYY-MM-DD",
    "last_updated_note": "optional human note",
    "completions_since_reprioritization": 0,
    "reprioritize_threshold": 5,
    "last_reprioritized": "YYYY-MM-DD",
    "reprioritization_strategy": "dependency-first"
  },
  "tasks": [
    {
      "id": "t2-short-slug",
      "title": "Task Title",
      "tier": "T1 | T2 | T3 | Roadmap",
      "status": "pending | in_progress | blocked",
      "description": "One sentence, 80-120 chars max.",
      "depends_on": ["Title of dependency task"],
      "unblocks": ["Title of task this unblocks"],
      "requires_patch": true
    }
  ]
}
```

**Tier conventions:** T1 = architectural/high design impact, T2 = subsystem, T3 = docs/polish, Roadmap = future.
**Status values:** `pending`, `in_progress`, `blocked`.
**Single-file rule:** Every tier lives in `tasks.json`. Order is maintained by REPRIORITIZE (T1 before T2 before T3 before Roadmap, dependencies before dependents within each tier). There is no `tasks_backlog.json`.
**Description rule:** One sentence, 80-120 chars. No implementation details, no doc references. WHAT not HOW.
**`requires_patch`:** Optional. Set `true` if the task modifies scaffold templates that downstream projects depend on — triggers a patch-catalog gate on COMPLETE.
**`completions_since_reprioritization`:** Still incremented on every COMPLETE for HEALTH visibility, but COMPLETE no longer auto-prompts when it crosses the threshold. Invoke REPRIORITIZE manually when you want it.

---

## Token Discipline

**Hard cap: 15 tasks max loaded per operation.** If `tasks.json` exceeds 15 tasks, RECOMMEND reads only the first 15 (they are already priority-sorted). REPRIORITIZE, REVIEW, and HEALTH read the full file unconditionally.

- Read the file once per operation, parse only the fields needed.
- For ADD / COMPLETE / RECOMMEND: read the file, make the change in memory, write back in one shot.
- Never re-read a file already loaded in the current turn.

---

## Step 1: Check Init State

Glob for `Reference/Claude/tasks.json`. If missing → run Init. If present → skip to the requested sub-flow.

---

## Init Flow (first run only)

Create `Reference/Claude/tasks.json` with empty structure:

```json
{
  "meta": {
    "last_updated": "[today]",
    "last_updated_note": "initialized",
    "completions_since_reprioritization": 0,
    "reprioritize_threshold": 5,
    "last_reprioritized": "[today]",
    "reprioritization_strategy": "dependency-first"
  },
  "tasks": []
}
```

Do NOT create `tasks_completed.log` at init — it is created lazily on the first COMPLETE call.

### CLAUDE.md Task Module Section (overwrite policy)

Open the project CLAUDE.md (create a minimal one if none exists). Search for any existing section heading matching:
- `## Task Backlog` (any subtitle)
- `## Task Module` (any subtitle)
- Any numbered variant (`## 9. Task Backlog`, `## 9. Task Module`, etc.)

**If found:** Find-and-replace the entire section (heading through end of section, up to but not including the next `##` heading) with the standard Task Module text below.

**If not found:** Append the standard Task Module text to the end of CLAUDE.md.

Preserve any project-specific section number prefix if the existing section had one (e.g. `## 9. ...` stays `## 9. Task Module — Backlog Management Standard`).

**Standard Task Module text to write:**

```markdown
## Task Module — Backlog Management Standard

> **Applies to:** Any project that uses the `task` skill for cross-session backlog management. This section is the standard scaffold installed by the `task` skill on first run. Do not edit individual rules without updating the skill.

### Single Source of Truth

`Reference/Claude/tasks.json` holds every task at every tier (T1, T2, T3, Roadmap). There is no separate backlog file. Order within the file is authoritative — REPRIORITIZE is the only way tasks move within the stack.

### Session Start — RECOMMEND Flow

At session start, read `Reference/Claude/tasks.json` and surface the top 1–3 actionable T1/T2 tasks via `AskUserQuestion` before any other work begins. Trust the existing order: REPRIORITIZE produces a dependency-aware ranking, so the top of the file is already the right answer. Wait for user confirmation before starting.

**Button rendering rule:** Task-picker flows use a numbered prose list plus number-only button labels (`1` / `2` / `3` / `Show all`) so long titles never break rendering. The full title appears in the option description, not the button label.

**Before surfacing tasks:** Check for in-progress tasks from last session (Step 2a) and for invalid `"completed"` status values (Step 2b). Resolve both before picking new work.

**Empty state:** If there are no actionable T1/T2 tasks (all complete, all blocked, or none of that tier exist), run the EMPTY-STATE FLOW to surface Roadmap items to promote to tasks, or Ideas to promote to the Roadmap.

**Cross-session signal:** When the user selects a task, immediately write `status: "in_progress"` for that task before starting work. This is what Step 2a detects next session.

### Immediate Completion (MANDATORY)

When a task is fully done — all steps finished, files written, docs propagated — call `task COMPLETE` immediately. Do **not** wait for session close or explicit user instruction. COMPLETE is write-first: the task is removed from `tasks.json` and a line is appended to `tasks_completed.log` **before** any prompt appears. Never leave a finished task in `pending` or `in_progress` between work items — `tasks.json` must stay in sync with reality at all times.

### Terminal Menu (post-close action picker)

After the write, COMPLETE always issues a single `AskUserQuestion` terminal menu with up to 4 options: **Next: [unblocked dependent]** · **Next: [second slot]** · **Close session** · **Reopen [Title]**. The menu is a post-close action picker, not a gate to closure — the task is already committed closed when the menu appears. Picking **Next:** sets that task's `status` to `in_progress`. Picking **Close session** is the clean exit (no further writes). Picking **Reopen** is an explicit revert: it restores the task to `in_progress`, strips the completion log line, and decrements the counter. Single-focus invariant: the menu promotes at most one task.

### Patch Gate (if `requires_patch: true`)

Tasks that modify scaffold templates downstream projects depend on must be flagged with `"requires_patch": true`. When present, a blocking patch gate runs **before** the terminal menu: *"This task touched scaffold templates — did you update the patch catalog and rebundle?"* with options **"Yes, done"** / **"Not yet — reopen the task"**. If not yet, the task is restored to `in_progress`, the log line is removed, the counter is decremented, and the terminal menu is skipped.

### Reprioritization

REPRIORITIZE is invoked manually when the user wants it. The meta counter `completions_since_reprioritization` is still incremented on every COMPLETE so HEALTH can surface it, but COMPLETE no longer auto-prompts to run REPRIORITIZE. Run it on demand: *"reprioritize"* / *"reorder the backlog"*.

### Keep tasks.json Current

`Reference/Claude/tasks.json` is the cross-session task backlog and the single source of truth. When new work is discovered mid-session — either by Claude noticing a follow-up or by the user mentioning something — call `task ADD` immediately rather than mentioning it in chat and forgetting. Treat user-added entries as authoritative: do not second-guess priority, retitle, or reorder them without explicit instruction.

### Propagate Design Changes to Documentation Same-Session

After any design decision or architectural change, update all relevant `Reference/*.md` and `Documentation/md/*.md` files in the same session. Create a new Reference doc if none exists for the topic. Do not close a session with design decisions captured only in `tasks.json` or session memory — they must be fully encoded in documentation files.

If the project uses CPS (Claude Project System), CPS indexes these docs; stale docs mean stale query results. **After doc updates, run `cps-refresh` to re-index changed files before session close.**
```

Confirm: "Task backlog initialized. Standard Task Module section written to CLAUDE.md. Ready to add your first task."

---

## RECOMMEND (session startup)

**Token budget: minimal.** This runs on every session open.

1. Read `Reference/Claude/tasks.json` only. Parse tasks array. If more than 15 tasks, truncate to first 15 (they are priority-sorted).

### Step 2a — In-progress check (runs before surfacing any pending work)

If any task has `"status": "in_progress"`, pause and ask first via `AskUserQuestion`:

- **"Yes, mark complete"** — run COMPLETE for that task (remove + log), then continue to step 3.
- **"No, keep working on it"** — surface it as the sole recommendation (skip steps 3–6), then go to step 7.

Label the question: *"'[Title]' was in progress last session — was it completed?"*

### Step 2b — Invalid status guard

If any task has `"status": "completed"` (not a valid active-file status — tasks must be removed on completion, not status-flagged), treat it as a data error and ask via `AskUserQuestion`:

- **"Remove and log it"** — run COMPLETE (removes from array, appends to log).
- **"Reopen as pending"** — set `status: "pending"` and write back.

Label the question: *"'[Title]' has status 'completed' but was never removed from tasks.json — fix it now?"*

### Step 3 — Filter and pick

3. Filter remaining: skip `blocked` tasks, skip T3 and Roadmap tiers (RECOMMEND only surfaces T1/T2).
4. From remaining, select top 1-3 by position order (first = highest priority).
5. For each candidate, extract only: `title`, `tier`, `status`.

### Step 4 — Present (numbered button pattern)

6. Print the numbered list in prose, one line per candidate:
   ```
   1. [Title] — [tier]
   2. [Title] — [tier]
   3. [Title] — [tier]
   ```

   Then present `AskUserQuestion` with up to 4 options:
   - Label `1` / description: full title
   - Label `2` / description: full title
   - Label `3` / description: full title
   - Label `Show all` / description: "See every task in tasks.json including T3 and Roadmap"

   Only include numbers that correspond to real candidates. If there are 2 tasks, only options `1`, `2`, and `Show all`.

### Step 5 — Mark in progress

7. When the user selects a numbered task → immediately write `status: "in_progress"` for that task to `tasks.json` before starting any work. This creates the cross-session signal Step 2a detects next session.

   If the user selects **"Show all"** → run REVIEW flow instead.

### Empty state

If step 4 yields 0 candidates (all blocked, or no T1/T2 tasks in the file at all) → run **EMPTY-STATE FLOW** instead of presenting an empty list.

**Do NOT:** read full descriptions, load dependency chains, or enumerate T3/Roadmap during RECOMMEND. The goal is a fast, cheap pick-list.

---

## EMPTY-STATE FLOW

Triggered when the T1/T2 backlog has no actionable tasks (empty, all blocked, or only T3/Roadmap entries exist). Surfaces the next logical work from the Roadmap → Ideas chain.

### Step 1 — Check Roadmap

Glob `Reference/Roadmap/*.md`. Exclude `_INDEX.md`.

**If roadmap files exist:**

1. Read `Reference/Roadmap/_INDEX.md` for the title list (format: `- [Title](filename.md) — hook`).
2. Extract up to 3 titles (first 3 lines).
3. Print numbered list in prose:
   ```
   1. [Title 1] — [hook]
   2. [Title 2] — [hook]
   3. [Title 3] — [hook]
   ```
4. Present `AskUserQuestion` with options labeled `1` / `2` / `3` / `Skip for now` (descriptions contain the full title and hook).

   Label the question: *"T1/T2 backlog is empty. Your roadmap has N items — promote one to start work?"*

5. If user picks `1` / `2` / `3` → run **PROMOTE FROM ROADMAP** with the corresponding title.
6. If user picks `Skip for now` → end. Do not automatically surface Ideas.

**If no roadmap files → proceed to Step 2.**

### Step 2 — Check Ideas

Glob `Reference/Ideas/*.md`. Exclude `_INDEX.md`.

**If idea files exist:**

1. Read `Reference/Ideas/_INDEX.md` for the title list.
2. Extract up to 3 titles.
3. Print numbered list in prose.
4. Present `AskUserQuestion` with options labeled `1` / `2` / `3` / `Skip for now`.

   Label the question: *"Roadmap is empty too. You have N ideas — promote one to the roadmap to get started?"*

5. If user picks a number → tell the user:

   > *"To promote '[title]' to the Roadmap, invoke the `cps-capture` skill and say 'promote [title] to roadmap'. Once it is on the roadmap, come back here and I will convert it to a task."*

6. If user picks `Skip for now` → end.

**If no idea files either:**

Say: *"Backlog, roadmap, and ideas are all empty. Use `task ADD` to add a task directly, or `cps-capture` to save an idea or roadmap item."*

---

## PROMOTE FROM ROADMAP

Triggered when the user selects a roadmap item to convert into an active T1/T2 task.

### Step 1 — Locate the roadmap file

Glob `Reference/Roadmap/*.md` (exclude `_INDEX.md`). Find the file whose name or content matches the selected title (fuzzy match on filename slug). Read it.

If not found: ask the user via `AskUserQuestion` to confirm the exact filename from a numbered list of candidates.

### Step 2 — Extract task fields

From the roadmap file, read:
- **Title** — the `# Title` heading at the top of the file.
- **Goal** — content of the `## Goal` section (one sentence). This becomes the default task description.
- **Horizon** — `Now | Next | Later` from the frontmatter. Use as a tier hint: `Now` → T1, `Next` → T2, `Later` → T2.

### Step 3 — Confirm task fields

Present a single `AskUserQuestion` (this is a worded-options flow, not a numbered-picker flow):

Options:
- **"T1 — Architectural"** — promote as T1 with Goal as description
- **"T2 — Subsystem"** — promote as T2 with Goal as description
- **"Edit before adding"** — user will provide custom title and description in a follow-up turn

Label the question: *"Promoting '[title]' from Roadmap. Confirm tier?"* (Print the Goal sentence in prose above the buttons so the user can see what will become the description.)

If `Edit before adding`: ask for title and description in a follow-up plain-text exchange (NOT an `AskUserQuestion` — free-text input is required).

### Step 4 — Add the task

Run the ADD flow with the confirmed fields:
- `title` = roadmap file title
- `tier` = T1 or T2 (from Step 3)
- `description` = Goal sentence (trimmed to 80-120 chars; truncate if needed, never pad)
- `depends_on` = [] (roadmap dependencies are narrative, not task-graph; do not carry over)
- `status` = `pending`

Write to `tasks.json` via the standard ADD logic.

### Step 5 — Update the roadmap file status

Edit the roadmap file: find the line `**Status:** Active` and replace with `**Status:** Promoted`.

If the project has CPS (`.cps/cps_server.py` exists), run a targeted ingest:
```bash
python .cps/cps_server.py ingest --files=<roadmap_file_path>
```

### Step 6 — Report and offer immediate start

Single line report:
```
Promoted '[title]' from Roadmap → added as [tier] task in tasks.json. Roadmap entry marked Promoted.
```

Then present via `AskUserQuestion`:
- **"Yes, set to in_progress"** — update the task status in tasks.json to `in_progress`.
- **"Leave as pending"** — no change.

Label: *"Start working on it now?"*

---

## ADD

Extract what you can from context. Only ask for missing required fields — use `AskUserQuestion` for each gap.

| Field | Required | Notes |
|-------|----------|-------|
| title | Yes | Verb + noun ("Build login page") |
| tier | Yes | T1 / T2 / T3 / Roadmap |
| description | Yes | One sentence, 80-120 chars. |
| depends_on | No | Array of task titles |
| unblocks | No | Array of task titles |
| requires_patch | No | Set `true` if task touches scaffold templates (triggers patch gate on COMPLETE) |

If `tier` is missing, present `AskUserQuestion` with options: **"T1 — Architectural"** / **"T2 — Subsystem"** / **"T3 — Docs/Polish"** / **"Roadmap — Future"**. (Short worded labels — no numbered pattern needed.)

Generate `id` as `[tier-lowercase]-[slug]` (e.g. `t2-help-system`).
Set `status` to `pending` unless context indicates otherwise.

Read `tasks.json` → parse → append new task object → write back.
Update `meta.last_updated` and `meta.last_updated_note`.

**Insertion position:** New tasks are appended to the end of the `tasks` array. REPRIORITIZE is responsible for placing them in the correct position within the tier stack.

---

## COMPLETE

Write-first, terminal-menu. Happy-path is **1 prompt** (the terminal menu) with `requires_patch: false`. With `requires_patch: true`, add 1 blocking patch gate on top (2 prompts total). The terminal menu always runs — clicking "Next:" is the clean close.

**Ordering principle:** All writes happen in Steps 1–2 before any prompt. The terminal menu is a post-close action picker, not a gate to closure. Reopen is a post-close **revert** action, not a confirmation gate.

### Step 1 — Remove and log (MANDATORY)

Read `tasks.json` → find task by title (case-insensitive substring match) → capture `id`, `title`, `tier`, `requires_patch`, `depends_on` → remove from the array → write back.

Update `meta.last_updated` (today) and `meta.last_updated_note` (`"completed: [Title]"`).

Append one line to `Reference/Claude/tasks_completed.log`:

```
YYYY-MM-DD | task-id | Task Title
```

Lazy-create the log file if missing — no header.

### Step 2 — Counter increment (MANDATORY)

Increment `meta.completions_since_reprioritization` by 1. Kept for HEALTH visibility only; COMPLETE does **not** auto-prompt to run REPRIORITIZE when it crosses the threshold. The user invokes REPRIORITIZE manually.

### Step 3 — Patch gate (blocking, only if `requires_patch: true`)

If the completed task had `"requires_patch": true`, present `AskUserQuestion`:

- **"Yes, done"** — proceed to Step 4.
- **"Not yet — reopen the task"** — restore task to `in_progress` in `tasks.json`, remove the completion log line just appended, decrement `meta.completions_since_reprioritization` by 1, and stop. **Do not run Step 5.**

Label: *"This task touched scaffold templates — did you update the patch catalog and rebundle?"*

If `requires_patch` is absent or false, skip this step entirely.

### Step 4 — Silent scans

Run these in memory — no prompts. Outputs feed the terminal menu in Step 5.

- **Impact scan.** Scan `tasks.json` for tasks that list the completed title in their `depends_on`. Collect up to 2 unblocked dependent titles by file order (highest-priority first). These become the first "Next:" candidates in the menu.
- **RECOMMEND fill.** Run RECOMMEND Steps 3–4 against the remaining `tasks.json`. Collect titles until the combined "Next:" slot count reaches 2 (deduped against the impact-scan results). If the file is empty of actionable T1/T2 tasks, the menu falls back to the empty-state collapse rules below.
- **Doc-change heuristic.** Check if the completed title or its captured description matches words like `design`, `architecture`, `schema`, `spec`, `refactor`, `rewrite`, or mentions structural change. Remember this flag for the summary line.

### Step 5 — Terminal menu (MANDATORY, single `AskUserQuestion` call)

Before invoking the tool, print a one-line summary to chat:

> Completed **[Title]**. Counter N/M.[ Unblocked: title1, title2.][ Design change — update Reference/ docs same-session.]

Omit the Unblocked segment if no dependents. Omit the design-change segment if the heuristic did not fire.

Then issue **one** `AskUserQuestion` tool call. Header: `Next action`. Build up to 4 options in this priority order (stop at 4):

1. **Next: [title]** — first unblocked dependent (if Step 4 found one). Description = full title + tier. Picking this sets that task's `status` to `in_progress` in `tasks.json`.
2. **Next: [title]** — second slot: next unblocked dependent OR top RECOMMEND pick. Same rule on pick.
3. **Close session** — no next task picked. No further writes. This is a clean close.
4. **Reopen [Title]** — revert Phase 1: restore the just-completed task to `in_progress`, strip the completion log line, decrement `meta.completions_since_reprioritization` by 1, write back. No further action after revert.

**Collapse rules when fewer than 2 Next candidates exist:**

- One candidate: options = `Next: A`, `Close session`, `Reopen [Title]` (3 options).
- Zero candidates (empty backlog): options = `Close session`, `Reopen [Title]` (2 options). After the user closes from an empty backlog, remind them to run EMPTY-STATE FLOW on next session start.

**Single-focus invariant:** The menu picks at most ONE task to move to `in_progress`. Other unblocked dependents stay `pending` — the user can start them later by re-running RECOMMEND. Do not expand the menu into a multi-select; single-focus is what makes the next session clean.

**Resolution:**

- **Next: picked** → write `status: "in_progress"` on the selected task. Session boundary: the user's next move is expected to be either closing the session (to start fresh on the picked task) or continuing inline if they explicitly say so. Do not auto-start work on the picked task.
- **Close session** → no writes. Stop.
- **Reopen [Title]** → revert Phase 1 (restore task, strip log line, decrement counter). Stop. Do not re-surface the terminal menu.

### Removed from previous flow

- ❌ **Reopen gate (pre-close)** — replaced by the post-close Reopen option in Step 5. The task is already committed closed before the menu appears; Reopen is an explicit revert, not a confirmation gate.
- ❌ **Session boundary prompt** — folded into Step 5 "Close session" option.
- ❌ **Reprioritize auto-suggest** — counter still increments for HEALTH, but no prompt. Invoke REPRIORITIZE manually.
- ❌ **Multi-select unblocked promotion** — replaced by single-focus "Next:" pick in the terminal menu. RECOMMEND surfaces the rest next session.

---

## REPRIORITIZE

The only flow that moves tasks within the single `tasks.json` stack. Reads the full file. Invoked manually — COMPLETE no longer auto-suggests it.

### Step 1 — Strategy

Present `AskUserQuestion` with options:
- **"Dependency-first"** — sort by tier (T1 → T2 → T3 → Roadmap), then topologically by `depends_on` within each tier. Default.
- **"Tier-only"** — sort by tier alone, preserving existing order within each tier.
- **"Manual edit"** — user will reorder by hand in a follow-up turn.

Label: *"Which reprioritization strategy?"*

### Step 2 — Analyze and propose

Read `tasks.json`. Analyze dependency chains. Build the proposed order in memory.

Print the proposed order as a numbered prose list:
```
Proposed order:
1. [Title] — T1
2. [Title] — T1
3. [Title] — T2
...
```

Flag any orphaned dependencies (`depends_on` referencing titles not in the file) as warnings below the list.

### Step 3 — Confirm

Present `AskUserQuestion` with options:
- **"Apply"** — write the reordered array back to `tasks.json`.
- **"Cancel"** — discard the proposed order, no change.

Label: *"Apply this order?"*

### Step 4 — Write

On Apply: rewrite `tasks.json` with the reordered array. Update `meta.last_reprioritized` and reset `meta.completions_since_reprioritization` to 0. Update `meta.last_updated` and `meta.last_updated_note` with `"reprioritized: [strategy]"`.

**Do not write until the user confirms Apply.**

---

## REVIEW

Show a formatted summary of the full backlog. Read `tasks.json` once.

Output format:
```
## tasks.json — N total tasks

T1: [count] | T2: [count] | T3: [count] | Roadmap: [count]
Pending: [count] | In progress: [count] | Blocked: [count]

### T1
1. [Title] — [status]
2. [Title] — [status]

### T2
1. [Title] — [status]
...

### T3
...

### Roadmap
...

## Dependency Chain Issues
[any tasks with depends_on referencing non-existent titles — or "None" if clean]
```

Title + tier + status only. Do not print descriptions. Do not present an `AskUserQuestion` at the end — REVIEW is informational.

---

## HEALTH

Quick diagnostic. Read `tasks.json` once.

Check for:

1. **Description bloat** — any description > 120 chars → list them.
2. **Orphaned dependencies** — `depends_on` or `unblocks` referencing titles that do not exist in the file.
3. **Stale in_progress** — tasks marked `in_progress` with no session activity (flag for user review).
4. **File size** — if `tasks.json` exceeds 15 tasks, recommend a REPRIORITIZE + prune pass.
5. **Counter state** — show `completions_since_reprioritization` value and configured threshold. If the counter is at or over the threshold, print a one-line suggestion to run REPRIORITIZE manually (informational only, no prompt).
6. **Completion log** — if `tasks_completed.log` exists, show line count and date range covered.
7. **Tier distribution** — count per tier, flag if any tier is empty or if T1 exceeds 5 (too many architectural items in flight).

Output as a compact diagnostic. Suggest fixes but do not auto-apply. No `AskUserQuestion` — HEALTH is informational.

## Sub-flow invocation cheat sheet

| User intent | Sub-flow |
|---|---|
| "what should I work on" / session open | RECOMMEND |
| "add a task" / "log that" | ADD |
| "mark that done" / "I finished" | COMPLETE |
| "reprioritize" / "reorder" | REPRIORITIZE |
| "show me the backlog" / "review tasks" | REVIEW |
| "task health" / "any orphans" | HEALTH |
| RECOMMEND surfaces empty T1/T2 | EMPTY-STATE FLOW |
| User picks a roadmap item in empty state | PROMOTE FROM ROADMAP |
